This is a simple script in Javascript, XHTML, and CSS.

It was originally created to teach a friend how to use numeric chmod modes, and the basics
of UNIX file permissions. It's a useful little script so feel free to use it for whatever
you want.

If you do use it, modify it, whatever, I'd love to hear about it! Shoot me an email at
yudi42@gmail.com.
